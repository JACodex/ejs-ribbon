            <p>The cards are more than just a tool, they are a mirror that reflects to us a higher intelligence. Their
                form
                and figures
                are spirits in their own right, given life by the tradition of countless souls who told fortunes with
                their
                aid. The
                Tarot tells the story of the Fool’s Journey and the archetypal forces that populate our universe (as
                well as
                the space
                within us). <br><br>In my years traversing the attics and swamps of this world I have become especially
                fond
                of the Italian
                tarot decks as
                well as related games like tarocchi and minchiate. <br><br>
                The link between divination tools and gaming is ancient. It goes back to the period where “games of
                chance”,
                “casting
                lots” and “telling fortunes” couldn’t be distinguished from one another as cultural activities. Perhaps
                because more
                people back then had the sense to regard these as dangerous activities involving spirits of destiny and
                providence.<br><br>
