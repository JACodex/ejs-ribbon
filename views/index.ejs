        Witchcraft is meant to be shared. Worked for and with others. As times get weirder and hellfire rises, ancient
        traditions of healing, power, and spirit congress are being revived. In this beautiful, stinking world, it helps
        to have a witch you can count on, a magician you can trust. <br><br> Iâ€™m pleased to be offering tarot readings
        and ELDRITCH consulting sessions. <a href="https://tidycal.com/magicbyribbon" target="_blank"
